# E-Commerce Data Analysis and Preprocessing

## Overview
This project involves analyzing and preprocessing data from a fictional e-commerce platform. The dataset includes information about orders, customers, products, and reviews, allowing for insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. The notebook is designed for exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and preparation for machine learning or further analytics.

## Features
- **Data Import and Overview**: Import and inspect multiple CSV files containing e-commerce data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, standardize formats, and clean datasets for consistency.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Create new features such as order timelines and merge datasets for comprehensive analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Investigate trends in sales, customer reviews, and order performance.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the following datasets:
- `olist_orders_dataset.csv`: Contains order-level information.
- `olist_order_items_dataset.csv`: Details of items included in each order.
- `olist_products_dataset.csv`: Product information.
- `olist_customers_dataset.csv`: Customer demographic information.
- `olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv`: Customer reviews of orders.
- `olist_geolocation_dataset.csv`: Geographical information.

- **Load Data**: Read datasets into pandas DataFrames.
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handle missing values.
  - Convert timestamps to datetime objects.
  - Standardize data formats.
- **Analysis**:
  - Merge datasets for comprehensive insights.
  - Generate summary statistics.
  - Create visualizations of sales and order trends.

## Results
Key insights from the analysis include:
- Monthly and yearly sales trends.
- Customer behavior patterns.
- Product performance and review trends.
